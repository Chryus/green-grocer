##create a checkout method that calculates the total cost of the cart
##when checking out, check the coupons and apply the discount if the proper number of items is present
##if any of the items are on clearance add a 20% discount
##if the customer has 2 of the same coupon, triple the discount
##if none of the items purchased have a unit price greater than 5$ give the customer a 10$ discount off the whole cart
# ##Objectives: 
# #Create a checkout method to calculate the total cost of a cart of items and apply discounts and coupons as necessary.

# #Dr. Steve Bruhle, your green grocer, isn't ready, but you are!

# ##Skills: 
# #any?, all?, none?, nil?, each, map/collect

# ##Instructions:
# Code generates a random cart of items and a random set of coupons. 
# Implement a method checkout to calculate total cost of a cart of items and 
# apply discounts and coupons as necessary.
